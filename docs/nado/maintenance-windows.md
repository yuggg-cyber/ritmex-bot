# Maintenance Windows

Nado features two fixed maintenance windows each week to deploy technical updates, new features, product enhancements, UX/UI improvements, and optimizations.

These windows are intentionally scheduled during periods of lowest market activity to minimize disruption. Users should expect limited app functionality for up to 10 minutes once a window begins – comparable to downtime on major CEXs and DEXs. In rare cases requiring more extensive updates, downtime may exceed 10 minutes; advance notice will be posted approximately one hour prior in the Official Nado Comms Channels.

> User assets remain fully secured on-chain and are never at risk during a maintenance window.

Not every scheduled window is utilized. A Status Bar in the bottom-left corner of the Nado app interface clearly indicates system state:

* **Operational** = All systems are operational.
* **Maintenance** = An update is ongoing (degraded app performance is possible).

For detailed real-time monitoring, visit the dedicated [Nado Status Page](https://nado-xyz.betteruptime.com/), which displays current and historical uptime for both the application and API, upcoming scheduled maintenance details, and monthly-categorized incident reports since mainnet launch.

The fixed maintenance schedule (in UTC) is as follows:

* **Window #1**: Mondays at 14:00 UTC
* **Window #2**: Thursdays at 14:00 UTC

Automated traders using the Nado API / SDK should account for these windows, as connections may experience brief downtime. For questions or coordination, reach out via support ticket or directly to admins in the Official Nado API Client Channel.
