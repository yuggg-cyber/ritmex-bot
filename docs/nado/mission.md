# Mission

We saw a market fractured by fragmentation and compromise – slow executions, thin liquidity, and platforms built for survival, not supremacy. Born from the battle-tested fires of Kraken and the Ink Foundation, Nado rejects the chaos. We engineer the world's most performant DEX: a powerful orderbook fusing blistering speeds with perpetual and spot markets – anchored by cross-margin efficiency.

Our mission cuts deeper. We hand traders the reins to tame DeFi's turbulence – funneling raw volatility into your clear signal, your edge.

Trust your instincts. Execute with unmatched speed, depth, and precision. Don't just endure volatility’s chaos, make it yours to command.

Nado. Welcome to the perfect storm.
